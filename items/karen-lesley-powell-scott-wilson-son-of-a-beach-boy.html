                  <pre>REVISED EDITION It never occurred to me that my life growing up with my dad, Dennis Wilson of The Beach Boys, would be of any interest to anyone. That is until I built The Beach Boys Historical Landmark on the site where my dad, his brothers Brian and Carl Wilson and the other founding members of The Beach Boys grew up in Hawthorne, California, the site where The Beach Boys phenomenon was born. A great deal of my dad’s life was undeniably self- destructive. I will not sugar coat the facts but at the same time, I want to let every-one know what a great person he was. He had the kindest and most sincere heart I have ever known. Despite his well-publicized addictions, I hope this book helps Dad's fans understand why his life was so messed up. I have tried so hard to get over his death but I doubt I ever will. I know I am a good person but like my dad, I have made some terrible mistakes. I have done bad things, been addicted to drugs and much more. But even though I had a privileged childhood, I am aware, that I've embodied many of Dad's demons right through to my adulthood. I know now that having such a lack of self-worth, I became responsible for my own self- destructive nature. Could this have been the same for him? Dad, I loved you with all my heart and I miss you every single day and I hope this book sheds light on the two of us and that whatever needs to be forgiven, will be.</pre>

                  <pre>The true story of the relationship between a boy and his rock n roll father, Dennis Wilson of The Beach Boys. Scott Wilson's memoirs are completely honest, heartfelt and told on a very personal level. From his earliest childhood memories of when Dennis was married to Carole Wilson Bloom to living with Chrisitne McVie, Fleetwood Mac's singer and keyboardist; the fun times, the crazy times, the sad times, the addictions and the death of a parent. Scott tells it all, exactly how it was! In 2005 Scott built the Beach Boys Landmark Monument which stands in place of the Wilson brothers home in Hawthorne California.</pre>

                  <pre>LATEST REVISION of Scott Wilson's rewritten memoirs, the eldest son of THE BEACH BOYS drummer, Dennis Wilson. Now includes contributions from POINT JUDITH'S Mitch Toney (BEACH BOYS SUPPORT ACT) and Carli Munoz (Composer of Bambu and BEACH BOYS former musician.) Brand new personal photographs (black and white budget edition.) Forward It never occurred to me that growing up with my dad, Dennis Wilson of The Beach Boys would be of any interest to anyone. That is until I built The Beach Boys 'Historical Landmark Monument' on the site where my dad, his brothers Brian and Carl Wilson and the other founding members of The Beach Boys grew up in Hawthorne, California; The site where The Beach Boys phenomenon was born. Thousands of people came from around the world to attend the unveiling ceremony on 20th of May, 2005. Since that dedication commemoration, there have been countless books, articles, and documentaries about my dad and The Beach Boys. Almost all have been the same rehashed story, mainly concentrating on Dad's tough battle with drugs and alcohol, and the seemingly eternal fascination with his involvement with Charles Manson. I never did interviews for any of these books or films because I did not want to be a part of any one-sided, or unfair portrayals of my father, but shortly after I built the 'Monument', I was having lunch with my friend Jon Stebbins (who has written many books and articles about my dad and The Beach Boys). He had just finished working with British producer Matt O'Casey on what I think is one of the best documentaries ever made about my dad, based on Jon's book 'The Real Beach Boy.' This project focused on Dad's musical achievements, and his life as a whole, rather than just the troubled side of his personality. 'Wow, Scott Wilson, the missing link. You are the only person who has never spoken to anyone about your dad'. It got me thinking. Would people like to hear about my relationship with my father? Incredible, personal stories of our adventures together? The life of a boy and his rock and roll father. A tribute to the good and crazy times we shared; my deepest thoughts and feelings finally revealed. A great deal of my dad's life was undeniably self- destructive. It would be pointless to deny the well-publicized facts, but at the same time, I want to let everyone know what an awesome person he was. Despite his addictions, I hope this book helps Dad's fans understand why his life came to such a tragic end on 28th December 1983. I have tried so hard to get over his death, but I doubt I ever will. Regardless of my privileged childhood, I am aware that I have embodied many of Dads demons right through to my adulthood. I have always lacked self-esteem. Just like my dad, I became responsible for my equally self-destructive nature. Dad, I loved you with all my heart. I miss you every single day. Perhaps this book will some shed light on the two of us, and that whatever needs to be forgiven, will be.</pre>

        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <p>
          With a career that spans over five decades, The Beach Boys have one of the most extensive discographies out there. Listeners typically approach their music through either one of their many Greatest Hits compilations or through their masterpiece 'Pet Sounds'. But most of the time they just scratch the surface and find it hard to know where to go from there, missing amazing albums such as 'The Beach Boys Today!' or 'Sunflower'.
        </p>
        <p>
          As lifelong Beach Boys fans, we thought we could build a better way of exploring The Beach Boys records by focusing on discoverability. The result is a browsing experience that feels like digging through vinyls.
