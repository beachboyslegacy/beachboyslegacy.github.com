Regarded as the sex symbol of one of the most prolific bands in musical history, Dennis, a long with his brother Brian Wilson, were haunted by their harsh and abusive father, resulting in a life time of substance abuse and Dennis' untimely death in a drowning accident in Marina Del Rey, Los Angeles, C.A in 1983. His eldest son Scott has never got over the loss of his father and has led a pretty much carbon copy of his life. (The book is co based on Scott's own demons, some shocking, and the affects of having a very famous, yet deeply troubled father.) The un-sugar-coated story of self destruction, sex, drugs and Hollywood gone wrong! With contributions from fans, friends and former musicians etc. Black and white personal photographs.

Now includes contributions from POINT JUDITH'S Mitch Toney (BEACH BOYS SUPPORT ACT) and Carli Munoz (Composer of Bambu and BEACH BOYS former musician.) Brand new personal photographs (black and white budget edition.) Forward It never occurred to me that growing up with my dad, Dennis Wilson of The Beach Boys would be of any interest to anyone. That is until I built The Beach Boys 'Historical Landmark Monument' on the site where my dad, his brothers Brian and Carl Wilson and the other founding members of The Beach Boys grew up in Hawthorne, California; The site where The Beach Boys phenomenon was born. Thousands of people came from around the world to attend the unveiling ceremony on 20th of May, 2005. Since that dedication commemoration, there have been countless books, articles, and documentaries about my dad and The Beach Boys. Almost all have been the same rehashed story, mainly concentrating on Dad's tough battle with drugs and alcohol, and the seemingly eternal fascination with his involvement with Charles Manson. I never did interviews for any of these books or films because I did not want to be a part of any one-sided, or unfair portrayals of my father, but shortly after I built the 'Monument', I was having lunch with my friend Jon Stebbins (who has written many books and articles about my dad and The Beach Boys). He had just finished working with British producer Matt O'Casey on what I think is one of the best documentaries ever made about my dad, based on Jon's book 'The Real Beach Boy.' This project focused on Dad's musical achievements, and his life as a whole, rather than just the troubled side of his personality. 'Wow, Scott Wilson, the missing link. You are the only person who has never spoken to anyone about your dad'. It got me thinking. Would people like to hear about my relationship with my father? Incredible, personal stories of our adventures together? The life of a boy and his rock and roll father. A tribute to the good and crazy times we shared; my deepest thoughts and feelings finally revealed. A great deal of my dad's life was undeniably self- destructive. It would be pointless to deny the well-publicized facts, but at the same time, I want to let everyone know what an awesome person he was. Despite his addictions, I hope this book helps Dad's fans understand why his life came to such a tragic end on 28th December 1983. I have tried so hard to get over his death, but I doubt I ever will. Regardless of my privileged childhood, I am aware that I have embodied many of Dads demons right through to my adulthood. I have always lacked self-esteem. Just like my dad, I became responsible for my equally self-destructive nature. Dad, I loved you with all my heart. I miss you every single day. Perhaps this book will some shed light on the two of us, and that whatever needs to be forgiven, will be.</pre></div></div><li><div class=child-item__header><h3 class=child-item__title>Son of a Beach Boy - Second revision: My dad, Dennis Wilson</h3><ul class=child-item__info><li>May 3, 2015<li>lulu.com<li>US<li>Hardcover<li>233 pages<li>ISBN: 1326249800</ul></div> <div class=child-item__body><div class=child-item__sidebar><div class=sticky-content><a href=http://amzn.to/2aJWCD7 class=amazonLink target=_blank><img class=child-item__cover src=https://beachboyslegacy.com/img/books/2015-karen-lesley-powell-scott-wilson-son-of-a-beach-boy/karen-lesley-powell-scott-wilson-son-of-a-beach-boy-2015.jpg alt="Son of a Beach Boy - Second revision cover"></a><a class="child-item__buy amazonLink"href=http://amzn.to/2aJWCD7 target=_blank onclick="ga(\x27send\x27, \x27event\x27, \x27Amazon\x27, \x27click\x27, \x27Item\x27)">Buy on Amazon</a></div></div><div class=child-item__book-review><pre>The true story of the relationship between a boy and his rock n roll father, Dennis Wilson of The Beach Boys. Scott Wilson's memoirs are completely honest, heartfelt and told on a very personal level.
